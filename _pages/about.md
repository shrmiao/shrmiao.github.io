I graduated in 2018 with a BSc in Chemistry (Adv, Hons, Class I) from the University of Sydney, Australia. I continued to pursue postgraduate studies at the same university, working with Prof. Gregory Warr (2019-23). In December 2022, I moved to the University of Oxford joining [Prof. Susan Perkin](https://perkin.web.ox.ac.uk/) as a postdoctoral research associate. In 2024, I was elected as a [Career Development Research Fellow in Chemistry at St John’s College](https://www.sjc.ox.ac.uk/discover/people/dr-shurui-miao/) (approx. £220k).

### Research Interests
I specialise in experimental physical chemistry and my research interests are centred around sustainability and self-assembly processes in solution. Specifically, I am interested in understanding the structure, interactions, and dynamics of atoms and small molecules in solutions. By combining a range of experimental techniques such as scattering, spectroscopy, electron and force microscopy, I try to bridge the gap in length and time scale between the atomic world and macroscopic properties of liquid phase matter. My current research focus on understanding the atomic mechanism of rapid carbonate mineral formation. This understanding is crucial for scalable carbon mineralisation for mitigating the effect of climate change.
